# vegetable-go

School project for a CRUD application. This was my first project using and learning Go, and it was very rewarding.

The project breaks some Go conventions I learned about later. My brain was so used to the C# ecosystem and I had to follow specific conventions to please the instructor.
The fact I was even allowed to choose Go in the first place was forunate.
